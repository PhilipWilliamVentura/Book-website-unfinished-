            1984 <br />
            Resume: <br />
            This is book written by George Orwell in the 1930's predicting what
            would happen in 1984. This prediction is dark and the author spreads
            his believe about the negatif <br> end he thinks our world will have
            Obviously this was only a prediction and we now know he was wrong.
            <br />
            Review: <br />
            This book was fun to read because you could see would the author
            could wrong and would he got right. <br />
            Reommandations: <br />
            This book could be hard to grasp for the younger audience and it is
            recommand to read this at an older age. Also this is a book that
            should be read to compare what <br> actually happened in 1984 and not
            only for entertainment reasons because you'll probably not be
            entertained. <br />
            <br /> Moby Dick <br>
            Resume: <br>
            This is the book about Issac hunting down a whale. Multiple event happen during the story that leave the reader breath-token and mind-blowned. <br>
            Review: Awesome book!<br>
